            <p class="white text-center">Energy is undergoing a revolution. The way we use it, the way we control it, and the way we access it are all changing.</p>
            <p class="white text-center">In the future, customers will receive a more personalised, hassle-free service, that enables lower bills while also delivering low carbon energy.
            </p>
            <p class="white text-center">Technology is a key driver of this change, because it will transform how customers interact with energy suppliers and will shift their expectations.</p>
            <p class="white text-center">For their part, energy suppliers will need to evolve beyond traditional roles focused on commodities and billing, to enable new types of energy markets and increasingly become a trusted service partner for homes and businesses.</p>
            <p class="white text-center">But while this energy transition is opening up exciting possibilities, it won’t be without its challenges. A new paper by Centrica and KPMG seeks to explore what these challenges are, how they can be tackled, and what the future of energy will look like.
              As new technologies and sector convergence integrate energy into other aspects of our lives, how will this revolution shape the UK energy market and change customer experience?</p>

            <p class="white text-center">Over 800 years ago, AB InBev found its humble beginnings in the experienced brewing hands of Belgian monks. 
                It was in their abbeys where one of our original beer brands, Leffe, came to be.</p>
            <p class="white text-center">Elsewhere in Belgium, devoted monks were experimenting with brewing techniques to create Hoegaarden, 
                a rich and citrusy wheat beer. These brews were so delicious they tempted the parishioners to skip church 
                and instead revel in the smooth and subtle notes of the monks’ labor.</p>
